Notes on Basic Git Functions:

Tracking Changes:

	git init: makes a directory a git repo
	git add: tells git to start keeping track of something
	git commit -m: tells git to record your changes
	git diff: shows changes so you can review them
	git diff --staged: shows changes b/w last commit and what is currently in the staging area
	git log: history of changes
	git checkout -b: creates/names a new branch

Exploring History:

	HEAD ~#: allows you to see older changes (ex: git diff HEAD~2 file.txt shows two changes ago)
	git checkout: restores to the latest saved commit

Ignoring Things:
	git ignore

Remotes:
	git remote add origin: connect local to github
	git origin push master: push changes from your remote repo to github repo
	git origin pull master: pulls changes from github repo to local

Conflicts:
	if you get a merge conflict you need to pull changes from github, merge, and then push
